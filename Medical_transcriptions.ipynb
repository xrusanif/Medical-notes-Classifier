       "'1.  The left ventricular cavity size and wall thickness appear normal.  The wall motion and left ventricular systolic function appears hyperdynamic with estimated ejection fraction of 70% to 75%.  There is near-cavity obliteration seen.  There also appears to be increased left ventricular outflow tract gradient at the mid cavity level consistent with hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function.  There is abnormal left ventricular relaxation pattern seen as well as elevated left atrial pressures seen by Doppler examination.,2.  The left atrium appears mildly dilated.,3.  The right atrium and right ventricle appear normal.,4.  The aortic root appears normal.,5.  The aortic valve appears calcified with mild aortic valve stenosis, calculated aortic valve area is 1.3 cm square with a maximum instantaneous gradient of 34 and a mean gradient of 19 mm.,6.  There is mitral annular calcification extending to leaflets and supportive structures with thickening of mitral valve leaflets with mild mitral regurgitation.,7.  The tricuspid valve appears normal with trace tricuspid regurgitation with moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.  Estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 49 mmHg.  Estimated right atrial pressure of 10 mmHg.,8.  The pulmonary valve appears normal with trace pulmonary insufficiency.,9.  There is no pericardial effusion or intracardiac mass seen.,10.  There is a color Doppler suggestive of a patent foramen ovale with lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum.,11.  The study was somewhat technically limited and hence subtle abnormalities could be missed from the study.,'"

Laryngeal edema can also be caused by tonsillitis,peritonsilar abscess or pharyngeal foreign body.It is unlikely that the patient has edema caused by abscess or tonsillitis since she does nothave any associated fever or other signs of infection and the sudden onset of her swellingalso argues against this. It is not likely a foreign body since ENT did not find anythingwhen they scoped her.It is unlikely that it is caused by a mast cell mediated etiologigy that increases vascularpermeability through mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediatorsinclude allergic angioedema, autoimmune mast cell release and direct mast cell releasecaused by medications such as opiates and radiocontrast media. It is not likely this typeof reaction because these etiologies are associated with urticaria and pruritis, which thepatient did not have. Also the patient did not have any exposure to a new pet, food,lotion or any other allergen or medication that could cause an allergic type reaction. Thepatient also does not have any history of autoimmune disease or any reaction similar tothis in the pastIt is more likely that the etiology is kinin-related where angioedema results fromgeneration of bradykinin and complement-derived mediators that increase vascularpermeability since there is no urticaria or pruritis. The most likely cause is the Altace(ACEI) that the patient has been taking caused an increase in bradykinin since itdecreases angiotensin 2 which degrades bradykinin. Bradykinin can then interact withvascular receptors increasing vasodilation, vascular permeability, increased cGMP andrelease of nitric oxide. This reaction occurs in .1-7% of patients treated with an ACEIand it typically involves the mouth, lips, tounge, larynx, pharynx and sublottic tissues.Half of these cases usually occur within a week of starting the ACEI but can occur yearslater. This is a class specific reaction not a drug specific and ARBs can cause the samereaction even though these drugs don’t effect the kinin metabolism. 50% of patients withangioedema due to an ARB also had an ACEI induced angioedema (Cicardi, M, Zingale,LC, Bergamschini L, Agostoni, A. Angioedema associated with agniotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitor use: outcome after switching to a different treatment. Arch Intern Med2004; 164:910). Deficiency of C1 inhibitor can cause angioedema since levels ofcomplement are reduced and cause increased bradykinin. This can be due to lack of C1NH or adequate amounts of nonfunctional C1 INH. Other causes of angioedema includeaspirin and NSAIDs since inhibition of cox and enzyme pathyway increases formation ofpro-inflammatory leukotrienes.\""

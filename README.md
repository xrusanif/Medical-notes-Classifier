# Medical-notes-Classifier
Medical text and anamnesis classifier for predicting specialty

THe problem...
The value on the solution might be found in helping a doctor to find the optimal solution for diasnostics order. 
Patient can save time and money, and doctor can serve a patient more efficiently on sparing time for unnecessary diagnostics. 
Moreover, in difficult cases the algorithm may help a doctor to find a diagnosis faster, which in some cases may be extremely valuable, up to saving lives.

This project aims to automatically predict the specialty reffered for a patient with certain anamnesis, and in extend the diagnostics needed.
The anamnesis is represented by a raw text file with doctor's notes about the patient, including his/her age, compaints described in free way, patient's history and so on. It is unstructured - different sections of each patient anamnesis may abscent in another's.
The target labels are represented by the name of medical specialties.
